# Ssssnake Whisperer

## ImaginaryCTF - Round 17

I created a really cool sssscript to hide a messssage from the other sssnakesss in the jungle.
I ssstill have the [hidden messssage](hidden.bin) but I sssseem to have losst the sssscript to reveal it again, I only have thisss weird [bytecode dissssasssembly](reveal.dis) left.
Will you help me reveal my messssage again? Take thissss sssecret, you will need it: `b"sSSss"`.
