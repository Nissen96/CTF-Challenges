# Koderod (code mess)

## De Danske Cybermesterskaber 2022 - Regionals

Argh, our newest developer is driving me crazy! His [code](koderod) is one big mess, full of strange checks, unnecessary function calls, and horrible naming - and it doesn't even run!

Can you find anything at all in this that makes sense?
