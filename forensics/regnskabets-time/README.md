# Regnskabets Time

Title is a Danish pun that translates horribly: "Regnskabets time" is the Danish version of "the hour of reckoning", but "regnskab" also means financial report. Best translation might be "The hour of accounting".

My colleague just sent me this [financial report](regnskab.xlsm) and asked me to take a look.
I have tried opening the spreadsheet and following the instructions, but I can't get the report to appear.
The file ending also seems unusual - can you help me?
