The time has come for the biggest military operation in Kolechia yet!
Their military is strong, we need to be quick and surprise them when they least expect us.
Our great leader and president has agreed to a ceasefire but has ordered me to plan an attack now that they don't expect us.

We strike their main military base in West Grestin and take back the land that belongs to us. We hit them at night, 0400 on Monday.

It is crucial this information is not leaked to anyone - we won't stand a fighting chance if they are ready for us.

Grestin will be ours
Kolechia will be ours
