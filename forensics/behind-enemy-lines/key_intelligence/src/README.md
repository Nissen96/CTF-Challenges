# Challenge Generation

The challenge is a capture of USB HID data from a keyboard during the writing of an email, which can be found in [email.txt](email.txt).
To generate the capture, simply download and run (USBPcap)[https://desowin.org/usbpcap/] and type the keystrokes from the email while it runs.
Optionally sprinkle in some typos and backspaces.
