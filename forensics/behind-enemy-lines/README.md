# Behind Enemy Lines

## De Danske Cybermesterskaber 2022 - Nationals

This is a 2-part forensics network analysis challenge based around the story of a current cyberwar where a spy has been deployed behind enemy lines.

The challenges can be solved independently from each other, but "Key Intelligence" comes before "Power Trip" chronologically and are story-wise meant to be solved in order.
