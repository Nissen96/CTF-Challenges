# CTF-Challenges

Challenges I have created for various CTF (Capture The Flag) competitions in cyber security, mainly "De Danske Cybermesterskaber" (The Danish National Cyber Championships).

Challenges are stored by category and within each, the main folder contains the challenge description and the files provided for the challenge.

The `solution` folder in each contains a short writeup and/or solution script, and the `challenge-files` folder contains the files used to generate the challenge.
