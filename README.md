# CTF-Challenges

Challenges I have created for various CTF (Capture The Flag) competitions in cyber security, mainly "De Danske Cybermesterskaber" (The Danish National Cyber Championships).

Challenges are stored by category. Each challenge folder contains a description and the files provided for the challenge.

In addition, each challenge folder has a `src` folder with any files used to generate and/or host the challenge, and a `solution` folder with a short writeup and/or solution script. None of these are normally available to the user, and if you want to solve a challenge without hints, ignore these folders.

Challenges that originally ran remotely has a `Dockerfile` included in the main challenge folder.
This lets you run the remote parts of the challenge locally instead, which you can then connect to as if they ran remotely.
A short description is provided in the readme on how to build and run the container.
